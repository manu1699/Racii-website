  <h1>Racii Cook Terms & Conditions</h1>
  <p>Welcome to Racii! These Terms & Conditions apply to all individuals registering as a Cook on our platform.</p>

  <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>

    <li>Maintain proper hygiene and food safety standards.</li>
    <li>Deliver food as described in your listing with honesty and consistency.</li>
    <li>Communicate clearly with clients and avoid last-minute cancellations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Payments</h2>
