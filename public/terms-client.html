  <h1>Racii Client Terms & Conditions</h1>
  <p>These Terms & Conditions govern your use of the Racii platform when booking Cooks and homemade meal experiences.</p>

  <h2>1. Booking Policy</h2>
  <p>Bookings must be made through the Racii platform with accurate information provided. You’ll receive confirmation once the Cook accepts your request.</p>

  <h2>2. Payments</h2>
  <p>All transactions are handled securely. Refunds or changes depend on the cancellation policy of the Cook and Racii’s general refund terms.</p>

  <h2>3. Conduct</h2>
  <p>Clients are expected to communicate respectfully with Cooks and ensure a positive, safe environment for all parties.</p>

  <h2>4. Allergies & Preferences</h2>
  <p>Please inform your Cook in advance about any allergies, dietary restrictions, or preferences so they can accommodate your needs safely.</p>

  <h2>5. Service Quality</h2>
  <p>Racii strives to connect you with passionate home cooks offering authentic experiences. While we review profiles and feedback, individual cooking styles and taste may vary. If any issue arises, Racii’s support team will assist to find a fair resolution.</p>

  <h2>6. Platform Responsibility</h2>
  <p>Racii acts as an intermediary connecting Clients and Cooks. We ensure secure payments and user verification but are not directly involved in meal preparation or delivery. Our goal is to maintain trust, safety, and satisfaction for both sides.</p>

  <h2>7. Account Suspension</h2>
  <p>Racii reserves the right to suspend or terminate accounts that misuse the platform or violate these terms.</p>

  <p>By signing up or using Racii, you agree to these Terms & Conditions.</p>
