RACII allows hosts to prepare meals that can be adjusted for children or guests with special dietary preferences. You can communicate directly with the cook to request kid-friendly meals or modifications. Please note that while cooks strive to accommodate these requests, RACII cannot guarantee specific outcomes or flavors. We encourage clients to discuss any allergies or specific needs with the cook before placing an order.
